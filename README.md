Worked in a team of three to reverse engineer a thumbtack by adding structural integrity for increased payload capacity. It serves as a multi-purpose component, which allows the user to pin the thumb hook into a corkboard and use the hook to hang anything the user desires. Some examples that the user can put onto the hook are a pair of headphones, a lanyard, or any other type of cable. Harnessed computer-aided design tools such as IntelliCAD and Creo to generate 3-dimensional prototypes.
